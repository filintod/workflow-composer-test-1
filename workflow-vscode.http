### Dapr Workflow API Reference for VS Code
### Generated template for interacting with employee_onboarding_workflow workflow
###

# HOW TO USE THIS FILE
# =====================
# This file contains REST API requests for interacting with Dapr Workflows.
# It's SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR VS CODE with the REST Client extension.
# For JetBrains IDEs, use the separate workflow-jetbrains.http file instead.
# 
# PREREQUISITES:
# 1. Your Dapr application must be running (use `make start` to launch it)
# 2. Your workflow must be registered with the Dapr runtime
# 3. Install the "REST Client" extension by Huachao Mao in VS Code
#
# VS CODE-SPECIFIC FEATURES:
# - Variables are defined with @ prefix: @variableName = value
# - Response variables use special syntax: {{ request.response.body.propertyName }}
# - Environment variables can be defined in .vscode/settings.json
# - Variables from one request are accessible in subsequent requests
#
# COMMON WORKFLOWS:
# 1. Start a workflow -> The instanceID will be automatically captured from the response
# 2. Get workflow status using the automatically captured instanceID
# 3. If needed, raise events to trigger workflow transitions
# 4. For debugging/cleanup, use pause/resume/terminate/purge endpoints
#
# SETTING VARIABLES IN VS CODE:
# - After running the "Start workflow" request, VS Code will automatically capture the
#   instanceID from the response and make it available to subsequent requests
# - No manual copying is required - just run the requests in sequence
#
# VARIABLES:
# - HOST: Automatically set to the Dapr HTTP port from your environment
# - WORKFLOW_COMPONENT: Set to "dapr" for the built-in Dapr workflow engine
# - WORKFLOW_NAME: Automatically set to your generated workflow name
# - EVENT_NAME: Update this value when raising events to workflows

# Ports should be the same as the ones in the Makefile and dapr.yaml file.
@host = http://localhost:3860
@workflowComponent = dapr
@workflowName = employee_onboarding_workflow

### Start workflow
# Start a workflow instance with the given name
# @name startWorkflow
POST {{ host }}/v1.0/workflows/{{ workflowComponent }}/{{ workflowName }}/start
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "data": {
    
  }
}

###
# This variable is automatically set from the response of the previous request
# In VS Code's REST Client, the response of a named request can be referenced 
# using the syntax: @variableName = {{requestName.response.body.property}}
@createdInstanceID = {{ startWorkflow.response.body.instanceID }}

### Get workflow information
# Get information about a given workflow instance
# Uses the instanceID automatically captured from the previous request
GET {{ host }}/v1.0/workflows/{{ workflowComponent }}/{{ createdInstanceID }}

### Raise event to workflow
# Deliver a named event to a specific workflow instance
# We did not find any external event labels in the current workflow, so this is an example of raising an event
@eventName = myEvent
POST {{ host }}/v1.0/workflows/{{ workflowComponent }}/{{ createdInstanceID }}/raiseEvent/{{ eventName }}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "data": {
    "approve": true
  }
}

### Pause workflow
# Pause a running workflow instance
POST {{ host }}/v1.0/workflows/{{ workflowComponent }}/{{ createdInstanceID }}/pause

### Resume workflow
# Resume a paused workflow instance
POST {{ host }}/v1.0/workflows/{{ workflowComponent }}/{{ createdInstanceID }}/resume

### Terminate workflow
# Terminate a running workflow instance
# Note: This also terminates all child workflows and has no effect on in-flight activities
POST {{ host }}/v1.0/workflows/{{ workflowComponent }}/{{ createdInstanceID }}/terminate

### Purge workflow
# Purge the workflow state from the state store
# Note: Only COMPLETED, FAILED, or TERMINATED workflows can be purged
POST {{ host }}/v1.0/workflows/{{ workflowComponent }}/{{ createdInstanceID }}/purge
